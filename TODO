- subcommands wgd should have:
	* ava
		all vs. all Blast; input is a CDS/protein fasta file. Output: blast.out.tsv
	* mcl 
		mcl clustering of all vs. all Blast results. Output: mcl.out.txt (paralogs.txt?)
	* ks
		Ks distribution construction, from either only CDS (pipeline mode), ava blast output, 
		MCL results or gene families. Minimal output: ks.out.tsv
	* adhore
		Collinearity analysis with I-ADHoRe. Output: multiplicons.txt? circos.png?
	* date
		Date WGD using BEAST and phylogenomic famework of Kevin/Rolf
	
Collinearity analysis should also output a file with gene 'families' from anchor points 
that can be directly used in ks.

WORKFLOW:

	INPUT: 
		- cds.fasta
		- genome.gff
	
	# perform all vs all blast
		$ wgd ava cds.fasta blast.out.tsv 
		
	# perform MCL clustering
		$ wgd mcl blast.out.tsv gene_families.mcl
		
	# perform I-ADHoRe collinearity analysis
		$ wgd adhore genome.gff gene_families.mcl adhore_out
		
	# perform Ks analysis
		$ wgd ks -gf gene_families.mcl cds.fasta
		
	# peform Ks analysis on anchorpoints
		$ wgd ks -adhore segments.txt cds.fasta
		
	# perform dating with BEAST
		$ wgd date -adhore segments [...]
